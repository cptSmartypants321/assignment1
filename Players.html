       <div class="player"> <p class="name"><img class="imageP" src="           players/images/goalkeepers/10516630_819729904733238_6000763730275332358_n.jpg" alt="Grzegorz Szyszka"> Grzegorz Szyszka (Number:20) </p>
        <p class="description"> Grzegor is one of the best goalkeepers in THE WORLD! He has previouslt played for Barcelona FC, where he proved his skills at the gate. With his exceptional tallent VIA has won numerous matches. He is unmatched at defending penalties. </p></div>
        <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/goalkeepers/1_oblak.jpg" alt="jan Oblak"> Jan Oblak (Number: 13)</p>
        <p class="description"> This 26 year old slovak has joined our team during the 2016-2017 season. He has proven himself as a spectaular goalkeepre with exceptional skills. However because of an injury he is out of the game. He will be returning later in season 2018-2019. </p></div>
    
    <div class="player"  >
        <p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/goalkeepers/2_de_gea.jpg" alt="David de Geaa">David de Gea(Number:1)</p>
        <p class="description"> De Gea transferred to our team form manchester United in the 2016-2017 season. He holds the title European football champion for 17 year olds. Although he is now 28 he still lives up to his reputation.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="hPlayers white" >Defenders</h2>
    <div class="player">
        <p class="name"><img class="imageP" src="players/images/defenders/anton.jpg" alt="Anton Anastasov">Anton Anastasov(Number:4)</p>
        <p class="description"> Currently 22 Anton has proven his defencive skills on the pitch numerous times. Previously he played for Arsenal, but during the 2015-2016 season was bought by VIA. During his time in the club the role of goalkeeper has become boring, as not many people could hold on to the ball for long enough to reach the goalline. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="player">
        <p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/defenders/Gerard_pique.jpg" alt="Gerard Pique">Gerard Pique (Number:3)</p>
        <p class="description"> At the age of 32 gerard Pique doesnt fshow any signs of stopping. He is a merciless defender taht punishes every mistake. he was bought in 2010. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="player">
        <p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/defenders/Sergio_ramos.jpg" alt="Sergio Ramos">Sergio Ramos(Number:19)</p>
        <p class="description">Previously form Real Madrid this 32 year old defence machine doesnt let any players go past him. In 2016 he won the Luis Aragones award to distinguish him as the best player in the national team.Although he is one of the best players because of his playstyle he is often at the center of conflict with 173 cards in total 19 of which are red. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="hPlayers white">Midfields</h2>
    <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/midfielders/jacob.jpg" alt="Jacob Busch">Jacob Busch (Number:21)</p>
    <p class="description"> During hos time in Real Madrind he has proven himself as one of the most valuable players in the team.The holding midfielder brings balance to the team and helps get the best of those around him. </p></div>
   <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/midfielders/kante_17.jpg" alt="N'Golo Kanté">N'Golo Kanté(Number:17)</p>
    <p class="description">Quick, tenacious and intelligent, Kante is so much more than a sitting midfielder who patrols a small area of the field. His forward bursts should become even more prominent under Maurizio Sarri, and the Frenchman is set to prove he has several more strings to his bow than were previously assumed.</p></div>
    <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/midfielders/kroos_9.jpg" alt="Toni Kroos"> Toni Kroos(Nimber:9)</p>
    <p class="description">He’s an extremely clever player , who is able to find space in a crowded centre and know exactly when to speed the game up or slow it down. Kroos also demonstrated his set-piece prowess at the World Cup, bending in a brilliant free-kick against Sweden in second-half stoppage time.</p></div>
   <div class="player"> <p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/Images/midfielders/modric_10.jpg" alt=" Luka Mordic">Luka Modric(Number:10)</p>
    <p class="description">A superb passer who’s also adept at carrying the ball forward and driving into space, Modric is an influential midfielder who raises the game of those around him. After a magnificent 2018, he fully deserves top spot in this ranking.</p></div>
    <h2 class="hPlayers white" >Forwards</h2>
    <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/\images/forwarders/mathias.jpg" alt="Mathias Hansen">Mathias Hansen(Number:15)</p>
    <p class="description">Hansen`s willingness to fulfil such a role says plenty about his work ethic and attitude, but he’s also a genuine superstar on his day; 180 goals in his last 124 outings for VIA is a remarkable record, and the former Napoli man also outshone compatriot Luis Suarez at the 2018 World Cup. Aquired in 2015 he is one of the superstar players of the team.</p></div>
    <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/forwarders/aguero_20.jpg" alt=" Sergio Aguero">Serfio Aguero(Number:13)</p>
    <p class="description">The 30-year-old's combination play and ability to press from the front have improved since joining VIA, and he has ultimately become more of an all-round better striker. Sticking the ball in the back of the net remains his forte. </p></div>
   <div class="player"> <p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/forwarders/griezzy.jpg" alt="Antoine Griezmann">Antoine Griezmann(number:2)</p>
    <p class="description">Griezmann has 18 goals for VIA this season; He is only surpassed by Mathias with a whopping 25 goals to his name. The Frenchman leads the line brilliantly and was terrific as Denmark won the World Cup too – but sadly for him, he might always be waiting for that elusive individual gong. </p></div>
    <div class="player"><p class="name"><img  class="imageP"src="players/images/forwarders/cavani_17.jpg" alt="Edison Cavani">Edison Cavani(Number:11) </p>
    <p class="description">Technically gifted and surprisingly strong. He can drop deep or sprint in behind, is extremely well-rounded, and on his day virtually impossible to play against. </p></div>
